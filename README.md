# PRAIM - _Project Action Items Manager_

### Introduction
When developing a software project, we often need describe changes we would wish to add to the software under development briefly (on the one hand) and deeply and exhaustively (on the other).
For this purpose we use the “screen-shot and describe” method consisting of two steps: 
- Snapshot a UI fragment related to the relevant functionality.
- Provide a description of the desired change.
At the moment this is done in a non-homogeneous environment including several programs for snapshotting, taken image primitive editing and providing necessary description.

### Our Objective
The objective of this project is to develop PRAIM - a software tool, for performing the above in a simple and a convenient way, allowing to reduce as much as possible developer’s time wasted for these activities.
The PRAIM tool shall manage the action items database; allow searching and filtering in, preparing reports according to a pre-defined format etc.
